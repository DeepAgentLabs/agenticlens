# Control Tower 0.8.0 live operations compatibility

Control Tower 0.8.0 adds periodic local detection over pushed telemetry, durable
deduplicated alerts and acknowledgements, attributed lifecycle audit, and a
read-only incident console joining inventory, evidence, findings, approvals,
commands and recovery checks. Fresh native Lens failures can open recovery
incidents; stale heartbeats and stale/missing evidence produce separate warnings.
Detection never executes recovery, and clearing an alert never resolves an incident.

Fresh failed native Lens runs can create Tower incidents. Tower marks Lens integrity as not verified and coverage as not assessed; runtime routing and ModelFit artifacts are not automatic detection inputs.

The detector uses the latest observation per deployment/producer, with a default
300-second freshness window and 30-second polling interval. It is not lossless
streaming or an external notification service. Same-run correlation stays within
an environment and does not prove causality. Deployment health remains reported;
evidence freshness, integrity and coverage are separate concerns.

No sibling dependency bump, new mandatory import or native artifact change is
needed. This compatibility update is documentation only and needs no patch release.

## Example operator workflow

```bash
agenticops-control-tower --token writer-token alerts evaluate
agenticops-control-tower --token reader-token alerts list --active-only --environment staging
agenticops-control-tower --token reader-token incidents view INCIDENT_ID
```

Use Tower's [operator guide](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agenticops-control-tower/blob/v0.8.0/docs/live-operations.md)
for rules, authorization, persistence, API/CLI commands and operational limits,
and its [standalone example](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agenticops-control-tower/blob/v0.8.0/examples/live_operations.py)
for detection, deduplication and acknowledgement without optional siblings.
