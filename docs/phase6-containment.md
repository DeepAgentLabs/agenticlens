# MCP Phase 6 coordinated containment release

MCP 0.6.0 pairs with Chaos 0.10.0 and Sidecar 0.9.2. Lens 0.12.0,
Evals 0.10.0, Tower 0.9.0 and AIOS 0.6.1 remain compatible. See the
[MCP operator guide and tested matrix](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/mcp-server/blob/c18f73decdc75aaac3e2e95004ae88589d587e75/docs/phase6-containment.md).

MCP binds hosted Tower credentials per authenticated user; tool policies still
apply and approval remains human-only in Tower. The independent operator stop
endpoint binds an exact owner/task to a live Sidecar runtime. Sidecar owns stop
latching, authority and dispatch enforcement. The MCP revoker waits for its
in-flight transaction before acknowledging task-dedicated credential revocation;
queued calls reauthenticate. Running Sidecar calls and unrelated credentials
remain harness-owned. Bind controls to the process hosting the actual runtime.

Chaos supplies native assertions over observed dispatch/completion and effective
acknowledgements, authenticating the exact ordered snapshot through Lens.
Failed, unknown, incomplete or missing evidence cannot pass. Tests include an
actual handler dispatch through a deliberately bypassed authorizer, which must
fail containment assertions despite valid snapshot authentication. Recovery,
output quality and resilience scores are separate. Evals v0.11 reusable
containment scoring shipped subsequently in Evals 0.11.0; see
[the updated matrix](evals-0.11-containment.md).

MCP retains its native access records and adds `io.deepagentlabs.access`, defined
in the spec-owned exploratory `drafts/access-evidence-v1` profile. No new
normative artifact or version marker is introduced. Coverage is producer-declared;
Lens authentication does not prove exhaustive capture. Tower preserves attributed
native outcomes and deployment health remains separate.

Sidecar 0.9.2 widens optional Chaos dependencies to `<0.11`. Other existing
optional ranges remain sufficient, so no other sibling runtime release is needed.
Hosted arbitrary chaos execution stays disabled. Reproduce the isolated seed-601
acceptance suite from the MCP guide; it requires the actual adapters without skips.

AIOS 0.6.1 denotes the existing Run/schema compatibility baseline. The new
exploratory access profile is in the coordinated spec repository revision,
not the historical v0.6.1 tag. It is not promoted to a normative schema family.

Evals 0.11 reusable containment scoring is delivered separately from this
original Phase 6 release. MCP 0.6.1 and Lens 0.12.1 provide coordinated
consumer compatibility. See [the updated matrix](evals-0.11-containment.md).
