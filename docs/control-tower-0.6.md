# Control Tower 0.6.0 compatibility

Tower combines Phase 6 (local MCP connector and investigation) and Phase 6A
(approved staging incident-to-recovery) in a single **0.6.0** release, paired with
MCP **0.3.6**. Sibling packages remain optional; no producer dependency floor or
runtime behavior changes in this documentation alignment.

Lens 0.7.1 supplies native failed/successful Run artifacts and diagnosis reports.
Tower preserves trace IDs, failed spans, tool names and dependency error types;
Lens retains analysis and producer attribution. Prompt versions are unavailable
in the native run contract and remain explicitly missing in investigations.

The first supported remediation target is Tower's deterministic local SQLite
staging dependency runtime. Exact-preview approval binds target, dependency,
impact, rollback and recovery criteria. Tower commits a consumed execution claim
before dispatch; duplicates and interrupted actions cannot automatically replay.
A successful command only awaits verification: fresh Lens success, a correlated
passing Evals gate and an independent successful probe determine resolution.
Failed recovery escalates. Production runtime adapters, hosted MCP tenant
credential binding, bulk operations and incident console views remain planned.

## Example and dependency matrix

From a sibling workspace, create a versioned Tower checkout (omit clone if
already present). The example first ships in `v0.6.0`; it is absent from 0.5.x:

```bash
git clone --branch v0.6.0 https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agenticops-control-tower.git ../tower-0.6.0
cd ../tower-0.6.0
uv run --with ../agenticlens --with ../agentic-evals python examples/incident_recovery.py
uv run --with ../agenticlens --with ../agentic-evals python examples/incident_recovery.py --fail-verification
make test-ecosystem
```

The two walkthrough outputs are `resolved` and `escalated`. The actual producer
matrix is Lens 0.7.1, Evals 0.7.1, Sidecar 0.8.0 and Chaos 0.5.3; MCP 0.3.6
exposes the real authenticated Tower 0.6.0 API. Native artifact readers do not
require those packages at Tower startup. MCP uses HTTP and does not import Tower.
`ai-operations-spec` 0.5.1 is a repository/catalog release, not an AIOS
schema version. Lens supports AIOS v0.4-draft only; Tower-local incident
contracts make no AIOS conformance claim.
