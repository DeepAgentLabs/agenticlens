# Tower 0.10 capability contract compatibility

Updated 2026-11-04.

Tower 0.10 adds authenticated `GET /contracts/capabilities` and the Python
`ControlTowerAPI.get_capability_contract()` facade. The descriptor publishes
`tower.capabilities.v1` as a candidate, with registration/heartbeat/readback JSON
Schemas, status values and existing merge/replacement semantics. CPython and
Node.js HTTP clients are tested against a live server and durable SQLite
readback. Existing routes and payloads remain compatible.

Lens owns telemetry, analysis and execution verification. Reported capability metadata is not authenticated evidence.

## Operator example

Against a running Tower server with a reader token:

```bash
curl --fail -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTICOPS_READ_TOKEN" \
  "$AGENTICOPS_API_URL/contracts/capabilities"
```

Expect `contract_version: tower.capabilities.v1` and `maturity: candidate`.
A writer token can also read this route; readers cannot register workers.
Use Tower's [Python and Node examples](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agenticops-control-tower/tree/v0.10.0/examples/runtimes)
for registration through heartbeat/readback. A duplicate registration replaces
the record; heartbeat merges metadata and replaces reported status. Reported
health does not automatically expire or derive from producer outcomes.

## Dependencies and release boundary

No runtime dependency, optional range, native schema or export marker changes
are required in this repository. No package patch release is needed for this
documentation-only compatibility update. Siblings remain optional to Tower.
The candidate is preparation for the coordinated ecosystem v1.0 release;
independent acceptance and stable freezing remain open. See the
[Tower contract and migration policy](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agenticops-control-tower/blob/v0.10.0/docs/capability-contract.md).
