# Chaos 0.9 compatibility

## Chaos 0.9.0 interoperability

Chaos 0.9.0 adds:

- resilience probes: `HttpProbe`, `ResponseQualityProbe`, `LatencyProbe` and
  `FunctionProbe` check steady state before chaos, while faults are active and
  after recovery. By default no fault is injected when a pre-chaos probe
  fails; `require_steady_state=False` runs the chaos anyway and leaves the
  score inconclusive
- a 0-100 resilience score built from recovery, probe, latency,
  retry-efficiency and cost evidence, with per-fault verdicts. Components a
  run cannot show (for example latency without a baseline) are left out and
  the remaining weights renormalized. The score is inconclusive (`null`) after
  a failed pre-chaos probe, for dry runs, when no fault fired, or when no
  component can be computed
- a local run-history store for score trends, with `max_runs` and
  `max_age_days` retention, and a `--min-score` CI gate
- probes and scoring on chaos workflows, experiment files and the pytest marker

Native event IDs and fault types are unchanged. `ChaosReport.probes`,
`ChaosReport.resilience` and the matching `WorkflowReport` fields are optional
and additive. When a score was computed, AIOS exports add a derived
`resilience_score` measurement; inconclusive runs export none. Probe results
and the score breakdown stay in the `io.deepagentlabs.agentic-chaos`
producer extension.

See the [v0.9 guide](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agentic-chaos/blob/v0.9.0/docs/v0.9.md)
and the [offline demo](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agentic-chaos/blob/v0.9.0/examples/chaos_resilience_demo.py).
The resilience score summarizes the evidence of one chaos run. It is not an
Evals score, a release-gate decision, a deployment health signal or proof of
containment. No new shared schema, automatic adapter or hosted execution
capability is introduced.

Lens reads scored reports as `Workflow` JSON and analyzes their `chaos_events` as before. The chaos-impact recommender does not consume `probes` or `resilience`, so Lens cost, latency and diagnosis findings do not change. Suite conversion rules are unchanged. Chaos's optional `agenticlens>=0.7.0` extra is unchanged, so no dependency bump or Lens patch release is needed.
