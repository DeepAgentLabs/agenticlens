# AIOS v0.6 compatibility

AI Operations Specification repository v0.6.0 delivers the exploratory
[canonical examples and extension model](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/ai-operations-spec/tree/v0.6.0/specification/v0.6).
Artifacts still declare `spec_version: "0.4-draft"`; the existing schemas,
conformance rules and compatibility catalog are unchanged. Independent review
remains pending; the repository release does not establish stable conformance.

Existing AIOS export and validation continue using v0.4 schemas and rules. Suite, ModelFit and routing artifacts retain their Lens-local contracts.

## Dependencies and examples

No runtime dependency floor changes or package patch release is needed for this
documentation alignment. The AIOS layer adds no Python runtime API.

To inspect the canonical artifacts, check out AIOS `v0.6.0`, run
`uv sync --extra dev` and `make check` there, then read
`specification/v0.6/examples/manifest.json`. It distinguishes valid fixtures
from schema-invalid and semantic-invalid controls. These checks need no sibling
package and do not constitute independent implementation evidence.

Producer metadata belongs only in permitted `attributes` or reverse-domain
`extensions` entries; it cannot redefine core vocabulary. Consumers that
re-emit an artifact must preserve unknown extension JSON values. Extension
contract validation is separate from core validation. A namespace does not
certify the payload, safety, authority or successful execution.
