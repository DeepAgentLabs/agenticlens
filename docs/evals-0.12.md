# Evals 0.12 API and report readiness

Evals 0.12.0 captures its public root API candidate and current report/gate
schemas in compatibility fixtures, executes all registered offline Python
examples, and publishes its CPython 3.10-3.14 support policy. The downstream
workflow pins Lens 0.12.1, Tower 0.9.1 and MCP 0.6.1 and installs the candidate
distribution over each consumer's locked environment before testing it.

Native report/gate schema 1.0, immutable schema IDs and AIOS `0.4-draft`
exports are unchanged. Existing public imports and compatible dependency ranges
continue to work. No runtime, schema or normative AIOS change is required here.
Scoring and release-gate computation remain Evals-owned; deployment health,
resilience, supervision and artifact conformance retain their own meanings.

The public/private module and deprecation policies are candidate readiness work.
The `agentic-evals>=1.0,<2` matrix and coordinated ecosystem release-candidate
acceptance gates remain open until that launch. No independent stable API or
AIOS conformance is claimed.

For an offline producer example, run in the Evals checkout:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run python examples/report-contract/generate.py
uv run pytest tests/test_public_api.py tests/test_report_contract.py --no-cov
```

Consumers must preserve a failed `GateDecision.passed` and unknown future fields;
schema validation does not recompute gates. See the
[public API policy](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agentic-evals/blob/v0.12.0/docs/public-api.md),
