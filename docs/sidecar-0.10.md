# Sidecar 0.10 contract readiness

Lens 0.12.1 retains sidecar.correlation/1 journal verification and projections; the new wrappers do not replace the native correlation reader.

Sidecar 0.10.0 adds opt-in candidate `sidecar.intent/1`, `sidecar.decision/1`,
`sidecar.audit/1`, `sidecar.scope/1` and `sidecar.transfer/1` contracts. Raw native
artifacts remain supported. Transfer requires a trusted host and live shared
AuthorityRegistry; private configuration is not approval, remote authorization
or a durable grant. Shared and exclusive restrictions all apply; conflicts
fail, readers intersect and earliest expiry wins.

See the [migration and supported-version guide](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agentic-sidecar/blob/main/website/docs/v0.10.md),
[offline propagation example](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agentic-sidecar/blob/main/examples/v0_10_contracts.py)
and [AIOS candidate mapping](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/ai-operations-spec/tree/main/drafts/sidecar-contracts-v1).

Operator example: keep existing native readback/dispatch integration; wrap an
existing Decision with `DecisionContract(schema_version="sidecar.decision/1", decision=native)` only when a consumer
explicitly supports that family. Never unwrap an ALLOW as an execution receipt.
Authorize private payload exports; redacted summaries cannot verify journals.
No new sibling runtime dependency is introduced. AIOS draft maturity and the
coordinated ecosystem v1.0 acceptance gates remain open.
